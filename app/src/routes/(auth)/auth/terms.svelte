        You are about to be authenticated via your Github credentials to Tutors. For some courses, Tutors may record how much time each view is active and send this to the
        TutorsTime data store. You can view this information via the Time feature on the profile menu.<br /><br />
        This data is available to you + the instructor of your course, but not to other students. No other data is gathered, nor is this data transmitted anywhere other than the TutorsTime
        data store.<br /><br />
        The Live feature, available from the profile menu, may also uses this data to display of panel of students currently online.
        <br /><br />
        You can opt out of these features by disabling the Share Presence option from the profile menu.
